After sorting a file (eg. with the very useful vissort.vim) you can mark an area (line- or blockwise) an remove any lines containing duplicate values within this mark, so making anything in the marked area uinique.

Ths most common use is:
mark a block
:Sort it
Remark the same block using gv
:call RemoveDups()
